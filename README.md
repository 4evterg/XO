### Just a simple project
I developed this game in 2013, just to test 3d on java. It uses [LWJGL libary](https://www.lwjgl.org/) and works only for windows. I can portate it for linux, but it is an old project and I dont wanna spend my time on it.
### Run and use
Go to folder 'woring app', launch Game.jar (java -jar Game.jar) and enjoy!
### Controls 
W, S, and arrows - change position
Spacebar - lock in
A, D - move camera
